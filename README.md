**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**  
  Utilizing a comprehensive dataset from NASA, this projcts aims to develop an interactive map that visualizes asteroid landings on earth. Our project aims to explore and analyze the patterns and frequencies of asteroid impacts in relation to geographic locations and time periods. The primary focus is to understand which areas on Earth are more susceptible to asteroid impacts, investigate if there are discernible patterns linking the type of asteroid to its impact location, and identify any historical periods where asteroid impacts were more prevalent. By creating a user-friendly and informative tool, we intend to shed light on these key questions in the field of space science and astronomy. This focused approach ensures a targeted exploration of asteroid impacts while preventing scope creep, making the complex data on celestial phenomena accessible and engaging to a broad audience.

*Research questions to ask:*
1. What country or locations has the most asteroid impact over time?
2.

*Rough breakdown of tasks:*

 
- Julia Dettman: find data source, work on year 2016
- Cameron Carson: clean the data, work on year 2017
- Jonathan Rascon: work on year 2018
- Kelechi Joel: work on year 2019, Readme
- Group Presentation: All
- Slide Deck: All complete individual slides  

**DEVELOPMENT**  
- Start by downloading the clean3data.csv from the resources folder to computer
- On a coding editor, install all neccessary installations needed to run the code
- Using pathlib, add a path to call the csv.data directly to your editor
- Delete unwanted columns and rows using the del function and dropna function
- create a function that helps automatically graph coordinates, this will be used in our correlation analysis for question 4
- Sort the data frame for only certain years and save those files to be analyzed
- To answer Question 1, plot countries vs Arrivals
- sort data for the first 10 countries, and plot that into a pie chart
- To answer Question 2, plot countries vs Tourism receipts
- sort data for the first 10 countries and plot that into a pie chart
- To answer Question 3, plot countries vs GDP
- sort data for the first 10 countries, and plot that into a pie chart.
- To answer question 4, build two scatter plots: one for Inbound tourist vs GDP, and the second for GDP and receipts
- Using the scatter plot information compare and contrast the relationships between these factors.
- note: If any data is a huge outlier, eliminate it and redo processes so analyses can better be understood.
