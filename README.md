#### PROJECT DESCRIPTION

  Utilizing a comprehensive dataset from NASA, this projcts aims to develop an interactive vosualization that showcases asteroid landings on earth over time. Our project aims to explore and analyze the patterns and frequencies of asteroid impacts in relation to geographic locations and time periods. The primary focus is to create a map visualizing which areas on Earth are more susceptible to asteroid impacts, investigate if there are discernible patterns linking the type of asteroid to its impact location, and identify any historical periods where asteroid impacts were more prevalent. By creating a user-friendly and informative tool, we intend to shed light on these key parameters in the field of space science and astronomy. This focused approach ensures a targeted exploration of asteroid impacts while preventing scope creep, making the complex data on celestial phenomena accessible and engaging to a broad audience.

*Research questions to ask:*
1. From the year 1999-2016 how many meteorites have fallen?
2. Using those years for analysis, does mass correspond with number of meteorite falls
3. In those years did meteorite falls increase over time?

#### DEVELOPMENT 

*Visualization-Analysis*

- Begin by loading depedencies(json,matplotlib)

- create path and load data into system

- create values for limitations of data for year (1999-2016

- using pyplot from matlib library plot year vs number of meteorite falls

- using pyplot from matlib library plot mass range vs frequency

- using pyplot from matlib library plot year vs number of meteorite falls
  


*Interactive Meteor Map*

*Meteor Heat Map*

#### ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
  
  There's an inherent draw to ethical considerations that aligns with research and business when it comes to our solar system and its contribution to everyday lives. Meteorites are very important for various of reasons. They're very informative on knowledge of our solar system and the formation of the earth 4.5 billion years ago, due to this it is imperative for society to be educated on findings and research that pertains to meteorite. Meteorites are also a source of metals and rare elements. According to Donald Yeomans, its estimated that the mineral wealth resident in the belt of asteroids between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter would be equivalent to about 100 billion dollars for every person on Earth today. Meteor minning has been an increasing trend lately from a lot of private companies who will like to access such minerals for monetary values. It is imperative society is informed by what steps these companies take and what limitations should be set to protect not only earths atmosphere but also core. 
  
  Meteorites aren't humans and due to this can't really give consent. Due to this there isn't a lot of ethics or protection of our solar system from private companies. This is because though it is believed that our solar system belongs to each and every one of us, no country or person(s) directly owns any part of the solar system, anyone is allowed to explore and research it. Still we believe there sholuld be limitations on what kind of exploartion and if any done, should be subjected to society awareness and education. 
  
  Our project aligns well with ethical processes that could arise from such research on meteors. Our data was retrieved from NASA who is an independent agency in splace exploration widely approved by the US government and have no bias towards any private institution. They retrieve meteor data from radars without compromising the atmospheric system that affects all humans on earth. The study of these meteors are done by tools which doesn't harm any human or animal in its course. By considering all these elements, our research had little to no complex conditons that could pose a potential risk to our solar system.
